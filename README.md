# Non-profit Redesign

This repo contains my final project for Kent State University Introduction to Web Design Spring 2023.
For this project I am creating a rough redesign of a real non-profit website.
The website I will be redesigning, as well as their Facebook, are linked below:

https://www.bcdc.org/

**THIS IS NOT A REAL WEBSITE** and is not intended to be. Everything here is purely for educational
purposes and is not intended to be anything else. Therefore information on this site may be extrapolated,
out of date, or simply untrue. Please see the linked website if you'd actually like to get in contact with
this group and want up to date information.
