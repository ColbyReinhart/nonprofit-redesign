			place to do business, a place where there is a culture that values, mentors and
			inspires business and institutions to invest here, expand here, create jobs here,
			and provide a good work place for their employees.
		</p>
		<p>
			Through our efforts, Barberton will become known throughout Summit County and the
			Northeast Ohio region as a destination location for businesses where their potential
			can be cultivated and realized.
		</p>
		<p>
			We want to create an atmosphere where our existing platform businesses can thrive,
			expand, and create a synergistic attraction to other businesses and institutions
			that are like-minded.

			private sector and public sector collaboration to create an environment for capital
			investment, business expansion and job creation. We want Barberton to be recognized
			as the “go to” business location place with a reputation for
			<q>getting the job done.</q>
